## Check out the live demo so far.

Here you go [DEMO](https://kwestion.me). The DEMO is just an idea.  If you are serious about joining this project message me and let's connect to create something unforgettable.

## What is this?

Kwestion-Me is an idea to reveal to us who we are most like based on those we call friends. and uses [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/).  It also utilizes [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/).

## Why should I join this project.

Check this out:
* it is build with Create-React-App :smile:
* it is based on a library [rmw-shell](https://github.com/TarikHuber/rmw-shell) witch keeps your project up to date when they make bugfixes or add new features. It is like a `shell` for your project where the hard work is already done for you.
* it uses Firebase :smile:
* it is a PWA (Progressive Web Application)
* you will love it once you start using it :smile:

## Some included features

Let's take a look at some of them:
* Material UI
* code splitting

## You like this? Can you help somehow?

YEEEEEEES :smile: Everyone is welcome to send PRs and if you don't know where to start just write to me on [Instagram](https://instagram.com/we_will_code). There is always some work to do.

Right now we need to allow members to add friends.
We also want to allow users to answers questions.
Lastly we want to create valuable graphs comparing questions.
We want to have a large variety of questions.  Some graphs may be "Same Answers Graph" which show which friends answered the same answer, while other graphs can be "Similar likes" which graph based on categories of answers and genres, etc.  
Everyone gets a certain amount of questions a day, unless they pay for more.
