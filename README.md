Here you go [DEMO](https://kwestion.me). The DEMO is just an idea.  If you are serious about joining this project message me and let's connect to create something unforgettable.

## What is this?

Kwestion-Me is an idea to reveal to us who we are most like based on those we call friends. and uses [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/) that uses [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/).

## Why should I join this project.

Check this out:
* it is build with CRA  You will be able to make every Create-React-App :smile:
* it is based on a library [rmw-shell](https://github.com/TarikHuber/rmw-shell) witch keeps your project up to date when they make bugfixes or add new features. It is like a `shell` for your project where the hard work is already done for you.
* it uses Firebase :smile:
* it is a PWA (Progressive Web Application)
* you will love it once you start using it :smile:
